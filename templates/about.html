      <p>
      This projet allows to get the id for an entire thread in twitter. It works
      by giving an ID and it take cares of looking for the previous tweets of the
      thread and get the following ones.</p>
      <p>
      The best performance is archived using as a root(starting point) the las tweet,
      since it just follows the chain. Using the first one as a root has the worst performance
      since it has to look after more tweets in a twitter search.</p>
      <p>The code for this project is available at <a href="https://github.com/yabirgb/hilos">GitHub</a>.</p>
